    "#### Context on TextDescriptives\n",
    "TextDescriptives is a versatile Python library that calculates a wide range of statistics and metrics from texts. It extends the functionality of spaCy, a popular NLP library, allowing users to gather insights into the textual properties that contribute to the text's overall comprehensibility and flow.\n",

    "The compute_text_metrics function will be applied to the explanations generated from both models. By doing this, we can quantitatively assess which method provides explanations that are not just correct, but also easier to understand and more coherent in terms of narrative flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Upcoming Execution\n",
    "As we run the evaluation, we will compare these objective metrics alongside subjective assessments to get a holistic view of each method's efficacy in explaining code. Stay tuned to see which approach yields the most comprehensible explanations according to both numerical scores and human judgement."
